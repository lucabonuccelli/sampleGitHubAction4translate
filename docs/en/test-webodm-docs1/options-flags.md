This is the complete list of options available in [ODX](https://github.com/WebODM/ODX). 


:::note
Some of these will not be visible in [WebODM](https://github.com/WebODM/WebODM) because they either don't apply or are integrated in the user experience workflow (e.g. GCPs are automatically selected, so there's no need to specify a `--gcp` option).
:::

## 3d-tiles

Generate OGC 3D Tiles outputs.

**Default:** `False`

## align

Path to a GeoTIFF DEM or a LAS/LAZ point cloud that the reconstruction outputs should be automatically aligned to. Experimental.

**Options:** `<path string>`

**Default:** `None`

## auto-boundary

Automatically set a boundary using camera shot locations to limit the area of the reconstruction. This can help remove far away background artifacts (sky, background landscapes, etc.). See also --boundary.

**Default:** `False`

## auto-boundary-distance

Specify the distance between camera shot locations and the outer edge of the boundary when computing the boundary with --auto-boundary. Set to 0 to automatically choose a value.

**Options:** `<positive float>`

**Default:** `0`

## bg-removal

Automatically compute image masks using AI to remove the background. Experimental.

**Default:** `False`

**Options:** `<json>`

## build-overviews

Build orthophoto overviews for faster display in programs such as QGIS.

**Default:** `False`

## camera-lens

Set a camera projection type. Manually setting a value can help improve geometric undistortion. By default the application tries to determine a lens type from the images metadata.

**Options:** `auto |  perspective |  brown |  fisheye |  fisheye_opencv |  spherical |  equirectangular |  dual`

**Default:** `auto`

## cameras

Use the camera parameters computed from another dataset instead of calculating them. Can be specified either as path to a cameras.json file or as a JSON string representing the contents of a cameras.json file.

**Options:** `<json>`

## cog

**Default:** `False`

## dem-gapfill-steps

Number of steps used to fill areas with gaps. Set to 0 to disable gap filling. Starting with a radius equal to the output resolution, N different DEMs are generated with progressively bigger radius using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) algorithm and merged together. Remaining gaps are then merged using nearest neighbor interpolation.

**Default:** `False`

## feature-quality

Set feature extraction quality. Higher quality generates better features, but requires more memory and takes longer.

**Options:** `ultra |  high |  medium |  low |  lowest`

**Default:** `high`

## feature-type

Choose the algorithm for extracting keypoints and computing descriptors.

**Options:** `akaze |  dspsift |  hahog |  orb |  sift`

**Default:** `dspsift`

## force-gps

Use images' GPS exif data for reconstruction, even if there are GCPs present.This flag is useful if you have high precision GPS measurements. If there are no GCPs, this flag does nothing.

**Default:** `False`

## gcp

Path to the file containing the ground control points used for georeferencing. The file needs to use the following format: 

EPSG:`<code>` or `<+proj definition>`

geo_x geo_y geo_z im_x im_y image_name [gcp_name] [extra1] [extra2]

image_name geo_x geo_y geo_z [yaw (degrees)] [pitch (degrees)] [roll (degrees)] [horz accuracy (meters)] [vert accuracy (meters)]

**Options:** `<path string>`

**Default:** `None`

## gltf

Generate single file Binary glTF (GLB) textured models.

**Default:** `False`

## gps-accuracy

Set a value in meters for the GPS Dilution of Precision (DOP) information for all images. If your images are tagged with high precision GPS information (RTK), this value will be automatically set accordingly. You can use this option to manually set it in case the reconstruction fails. Lowering this option can sometimes help control bowling-effects over large areas.

**Options:** `<positive float>`

**Default:** `3`

## gps-z-offset

Set a GPS offset in meters for the vertical axis (Z) by adding it to the altitude value of the GPS EXIF data. This does not change the value of any GCPs. This can be useful for example when adjusting from ellipsoidal to orthometric height.

**Options:** `<float>`

**Default:** `0`

## help

show this help message and exit

## ignore-gsd

Ignore Ground Sampling Distance (GSD).A memory and processor hungry change relative to the default behavior if set to true. Ordinarily, GSD estimates are used to cap the maximum resolution of image outputs and resizes images when necessary, resulting in faster processing and lower memory usage. Since GSD is an estimate, sometimes ignoring it can result in slightly better image output quality. Never set --ignore-gsd to true unless you are positive you need it, and even then: do not use it.

**Default:** `False`

**Options:** `<positive integer>`

**Default:** `0`

## matcher-type
