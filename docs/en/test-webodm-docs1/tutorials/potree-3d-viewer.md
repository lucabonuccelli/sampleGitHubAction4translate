### Appearance

#### Point Budget

For both appearance and performance purposes, the point budget on the scene can be managed. Some old and less capable machines would benefit from a 500,000 point budget while most mid-range specs machine are capable of handling 1 to 2 million point budget.

A 5 to 7 million point budget produces a smooth point cloud 3d model, but may result in a high resource demanding process.

Default point budget value is set to 1,000,000.

#### Field of View

In order to control model elements to be included within the scene the field of view can be adjusted. Default value is set to 60 degrees.

#### Eye Dome-lighting

The Potree Point Cloud 3d viewer module can implement eye dome-lighting, a lighting model that accentuates the shapes of objects.

Eye Dome-lighting group objects, shade their outlines and enhances depth perception in scientific visualization images. It is useful for recognition and measurement of structures within a model. It can be modified by adjusting Radius, Strength and Opacity.

By default, Eye Dome-Lighting is enabled on Potree 3D viewer, but it can be disabled by clicking on the enable option.

**Azimuth** — This tool measures the azimuthal angle of a line. This line is formed by two points selected by the user, the angle is measured in degrees, clockwise from 0 to 360 and starting from the geographical north. To start a measurement, click on the azimuth icon and then click on the desired two points. The process will be automatically ended. Further information can also be obtained from selecting this element under the scene section.

**Area** — This tool measures the horizontal area formed by a polygon. To start a measurement, click on the area icon and start clicking on the points forming the desired polygon (three or more). Right click to finish measurement. Further information can also be obtained from selecting this element under the scene section.

**Volume (cube)** — This tool measures the volume formed by a cube. To start a measurement, click on the volume (cube) icon and click on the model to place the cube. It is possible relocate, redimension and rotate the cube using the displayed handlers. Right click to finish measurement. Further information can also be obtained from selecting this element under the scene section.

**Volume (sphere)** — This tool measures the volume formed by a sphere. To start a measurement, click on the volume (sphere) icon and click on the model to place the sphere. It is possible relocate, redimension and rotate the sphere using the displayed handlers. Right click to finish measurement. Further information can also be obtained from selecting this element under the scene section.

**Height profile** — This tool creates a height profile formed by a line on the model. To start a measurement, click on the Height profile icon and then form a line on the model by clicking on the desired points (two or more). Right click to finish measurement. Further information and options, such as "Show 2d Profile", can also be obtained from selecting this element under the scene section.
